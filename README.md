# Introduction

Hey hello friends , welcome to another video, Now-days almost everyone has smart speakers in their house like Amazon Alexa or google assistant.
I have Amazon Alexa in my house , the quality of voice assistant is amazing. You can ask anything to Alexa and Alexa will give response  in no-time. Talking to Alexa is always a fun.
Apart from this we can also use Alexa to automate our home appliances.
That means we can control our home-appliances just giving voice command to Alexa.

And apart from this we can also able to control our home appliances from the manual switch buttons that we traditionally do. 

And also we can control these appliances using Alexa smartphone application. 
In this video we will learn how to make home automation system using Alexa and ESP32.
To make this project I will use my 4 node Smt smart home automation PCB.

Apart from this 4 node , I also have 8 node and 2 node home automation pcbs.

These pcbs are fully tested and works very well.

These pcbs have all the safety features like ac Electrical isolation.
